Community Mangrove Watch

Summary:
Community Mangrove Watch is a participatory monitoring system built during a hackathon to help protect mangrove forests. It enables local communities, NGOs, and government authorities to work together in reporting and responding to threats like illegal cutting, land reclamation, and pollution.

Problem:
Mangroves protect coastlines, preserve biodiversity, and act as carbon sinks, but current monitoring methods are slow and fragmented.

Solution:
A web/mobile app for incident reporting with photo and geotag.
AI-assisted validation of reports to confirm mangrove presence.
Geospatial checks to verify location accuracy.
Gamification (points, badges, leaderboards) to encourage participation.
A dashboard for NGOs and government departments to monitor and act.
